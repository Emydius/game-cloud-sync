# Game Cloud Sync

A quick tool for syncing a game's save data to your personal cloud storage (e.x Dropbox). Built in Javascript using Electron to be a desktop app.

Currently in-progress; goal is to have manual cloud syncing first and then build up to auto syncing when games open/close. Possibility: Steam Deck decky plugin?
